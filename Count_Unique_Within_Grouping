This formula is used to create a count of unique values within a selected value, for example:
- unique items for sale within a specific store location
- Unique employee names within a department
The formula creates a table to do this and when there is no return in the table it produces is empty
then the result is #CALC! which is counted. The NOT(ISERR removes this issue


=SUMPRODUCT(--NOT(ISERR(UNIQUE(FILTER('Candidate Row Data'!$D:$D,'Candidate Row Data'!$A:$A=BAU!$A2)))))
